## Vocoder

### Summary

A vocoder synthesises speech. It analyses a 'modulation' signal (speech) and uses this to apply filters to the 'carrier' signal (a synthesiser output).

A vocoder can sound more realistic by increasing the number of filter bands.

### Examples

Bob Moog and Wendy Carlos developed an early vocoder for *Clockwork Orange* (1970).

The vocoder was popular in the late 1970s and early 1980s:

* ELO: 'Mr Blue Sky' (1977)
* Kraftwerk: ['The Robots'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_8Pma1vHmw#t=65s) (1978)
