This is how it works: A signal is sent to a speaker driver The speaker is connected to a plastic tube. The sound waves travel up the tube into the person’s mouth. Their mouth acts as a filter, changing the frequency content of the sound. The sound comes out of the person’s mouth and is captured with a mic. Roger Troutman 2.2 Vocoder 2.2.1 Summary A vocoder synthesises speech. It analyses a ‘modulation’ signal (speech) and uses this to apply filters to the ‘carrier’ signal (a synthesiser output). A vocoder can sound more realistic by increasing the number of filter bands. 2.2.2 Examples Bob Moog and Wendy Carlos developed an early vocoder for Clockwork Orange (1970). The vocoder was popular in the late 1970s and early 1980s: ELO: ‘Mr Blue Sky’ (1977) Kraftwerk: ‘The Robots’ (1978) 2.2.3 Quick Logic tutorial "]
